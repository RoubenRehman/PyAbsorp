This is a package developed to be use to find the _Sound Absorption Coefficient_ through some implemented models, like  _Biot-Allard_, _Johnson-Champoux_ and others.
This project is in the alpha stage.

## Dependencies
**PyAbsorp** runs under Linux, Windows and MacOS, a **Python 3.8.10** installation is needed with the latest **Numpy (1.20.3 or higher)** , **Scipy (1.6.3 or higher)** and **Pydantic (1.8.2 or higher)**.
_Matplotlib is recommended, but not necessary._

## Implemented Models
- **Delany-Bazley** (with **Miki** and **Allard-Champoux** variation)
- **Biot-Allard**
- **Johnson-Champoux** (with **Allard** and **Lafarge** variation)
- **Rayleigh**

## How to Install
1. First make sure that you have the package [*setuptools*](https://pypi.org/project/setuptools/) installed.
2. Install through pip, by using the following command:
    ``` pip install git+https://github.com/Toktom/PyAbsorp ```
    
## Future Objectives
- [ ] Code validation
- [ ] Implementation of absorbers models.
- [ ] Theoretical review of the implemented models.
- [ ] English review
